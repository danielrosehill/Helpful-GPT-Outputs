Here are 10 different methods you could use to automatically create daily backups of your GitHub repositories (both public and private) onto your Synology NAS:

### 1. **Cron Job with Shell Script**

- **Overview:** Create a shell script that uses the GitHub API to list all repositories and then clones or pulls them to your Synology NAS. Schedule this script with a cron job to run daily.

- **Tools Required:** Git, curl, jq, cron.

- **Pros:** Simple, easy to customize.

- **Cons:** Requires basic scripting knowledge.

### 2. **Docker Container with GitHub Backup Tool**

- **Overview:** Use a pre-built Docker container that runs a GitHub backup tool, such as github-backup, to automatically back up your repositories. Schedule the container to run daily using Synology’s Docker GUI or a cron job.

- **Tools Required:** Docker, github-backup or similar tools.

- **Pros:** Isolated environment, easy to manage dependencies.

- **Cons:** Requires Docker setup on Synology NAS.

### 3. **Synology Hyper Backup**

- **Overview:** Set up a scheduled task in Synology Hyper Backup to back up the folder where your GitHub repositories are cloned to your NAS.

- **Tools Required:** Hyper Backup, shell script or Docker for cloning repositories.

- **Pros:** Integrated Synology solution, reliable backups.

- **Cons:** Requires additional scripting for initial repository cloning.

### 4. **Synology Task Scheduler with SSH Script**

- **Overview:** Write a shell script that clones or pulls your repositories and use the Synology Task Scheduler to run the script daily.

- **Tools Required:** Git, Synology Task Scheduler.

- **Pros:** No need for external tools, integrated scheduling.

- **Cons:** Requires scripting and SSH setup.

### 5. **GitHub Actions with Synology NAS Sync**

- **Overview:** Create a GitHub Action that triggers daily to sync your repositories to your Synology NAS using SSH or rsync.

- **Tools Required:** GitHub Actions, SSH access to Synology.

- **Pros:** Managed directly within GitHub, flexible.

- **Cons:** Requires GitHub Actions knowledge and setup.

### 6. **Using rclone with Cron Job**

- **Overview:** Use rclone to sync your GitHub repositories to your Synology NAS. rclone can handle various cloud storage systems, and you can schedule it with cron to run daily.

- **Tools Required:** rclone, cron.

- **Pros:** Versatile tool, supports multiple storage options.

- **Cons:** Initial setup might be complex.

### 7. **Synology Git Server with Mirroring**

- **Overview:** Set up the Synology Git Server package and configure it to mirror your GitHub repositories. This can be done by adding your GitHub repositories as remotes and fetching updates daily.

- **Tools Required:** Synology Git Server, Git.

- **Pros:** Integrated Git solution on NAS.

- **Cons:** Requires Git Server setup and maintenance.

### 8. **GitHub Webhook with Synology Script**

- **Overview:** Set up a GitHub webhook that triggers a script on your Synology NAS whenever changes are pushed to your repositories. This script can pull the latest changes to the NAS.

- **Tools Required:** GitHub Webhook, SSH, Git.

- **Pros:** Real-time updates, no need for scheduled backups.

- **Cons:** More complex setup, requires web server access on Synology.

### 9. **Synology Cloud Sync with GitHub as Remote**

- **Overview:** Use Synology Cloud Sync to connect to a third-party service like AWS S3, where your GitHub repositories are backed up daily. Then, sync that S3 bucket to your NAS.

- **Tools Required:** Cloud Sync, S3-compatible backup service.

- **Pros:** Flexible, handles large backups well.

- **Cons:** Requires additional cloud service.

### 10. **Using git-sync in a Docker Container**

- **Overview:** Run a Docker container with the git-sync tool on your Synology NAS, which will continuously monitor your GitHub repositories and sync changes.

- **Tools Required:** Docker, git-sync.

- **Pros:** Continuous synchronization, lightweight solution.

- **Cons:** Continuous resource usage, Docker required.

These methods provide a range of solutions depending on your familiarity with different tools and your preference for either simple scripting, Docker-based solutions, or Synology’s integrated features.
