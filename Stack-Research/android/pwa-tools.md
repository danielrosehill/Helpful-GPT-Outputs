Yes, when you add a URL to your Android home screen, it usually opens in a new tab within the default browser, rather than as a standalone app-like experience. This behavior happens because the website isn't designed as a Progressive Web App (PWA) or doesn't meet the criteria to be treated as one by your browser.

### How to Ensure a Standalone App-Like Experience

1. Use Progressive Web Apps (PWAs):

- If the site you're adding supports PWA standards (has a manifest file, service workers, etc.), when you add it to your home screen, it should open in its own window, separate from the regular browser tabs, similar to how an app would behave.

- Example: If you add a PWA like Twitter or Google Maps to your home screen, they open in a standalone window rather than a new tab in the browser.

2. Browser Settings:

- Some browsers (like Brave or Samsung Internet) allow you to add a URL to your home screen as a PWA even if the site isn't fully optimized as one. You could try using these browsers instead of Chrome for this feature.

3. Third-Party Apps:

- Consider using third-party apps like Hermit or Web Apps from the Play Store. These apps allow you to create lite apps for any URL, giving you a standalone experience similar to PWAs, regardless of whether the site supports PWA standards.

4. Dedicated Apps:

- If the website you are visiting has a dedicated app in the Google Play Store, using that app will give you the best app-like experience. Some apps even let you sign in and keep your progress across sessions, unlike a simple web page.

5. Manual Workaround:

- If the website doesn't have PWA support and no dedicated app, you might have to manually open the URL every time, but you can reduce the hassle by using browser features like pinned tabs or session restore to keep your workflow somewhat uninterrupted.

In summary, while adding a URL to the home screen typically opens it in a browser tab, ensuring that the site is a PWA or using a browser or app that supports standalone windowed experiences can give you the app-like functionality you're seeking.
