# Open-Source Knowledge Management Platforms

Asked GPT to provide a list of open source knowledge management platforms for evaluation. Use-case envisioned: creating a scalable system for storing ChatGPT prompt outputs. 

Provided the tool with my requirements at the time of running the prompt:

- Android app
- Self-hostable

Asked GPT to return 30 unique projects to provide plenty of options to think about. 

Forgot to explicitly ask for URLs for each project but they would not be hard to add in with a prompt like:

`Please revise this prompt output adding the URL for each project listed.`
