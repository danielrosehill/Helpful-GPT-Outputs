Most saving and organizing functionalities are handled through extensions or third-party applications that integrate with existing browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.

Users typically rely on these browser extensions or API integrations to automate and manage the saving of content from their interactions with web applications like ChatGPT.
