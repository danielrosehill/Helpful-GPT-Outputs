Here are some of the best-supported voice-to-text platforms available on Fedora Linux, ranked by their community support, documentation, and ease of integration:

### 1. Kaldi

- Support: Kaldi is one of the most widely used open-source speech recognition toolkits. It has extensive community support, comprehensive documentation, and a large number of contributors.

- Documentation: Excellent, with a variety of tutorials, examples, and extensive API documentation.

- Integration: Kaldi is powerful but can be complex to set up. It’s often used in academic and commercial projects, making it a solid choice if you’re looking for a robust solution with a steep learning curve.
